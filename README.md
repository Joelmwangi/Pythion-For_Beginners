Explanation How it works:

           Introduction: 
The script begins with a print statement to indicate that it's the first programming assignment.

           Functions: 
Local functions handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and range checking.

           User Input: 
The user is prompted to enter a valid range, followed by two numbers.

           Range Checking: 
The IsInRange function checks whether both numbers are within the specified range.
If they are, all arithmetic operations are performed, and the results are displayed.
If not, a message is displayed, and the loop starts over.

            Repetition: 
The user can continue performing calculations until they decide to stop.

            Closing: 
A final message is displayed thanking the user for using the calculator.
This combination provides a complete, user-friendly program that performs various arithmetic operations with built-in range validation.
